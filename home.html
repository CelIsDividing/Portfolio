        Welcome to the deepest parts of the internet, the home of CellsDividing — where code meets curiosity 
        and ideas turn into keystrokes.

        Behind the alias is Andrej, a programmer 
        who builds things for fun, for challenge, and (occasionally) for profit. 
        Whether you're here to scout talent, collaborate, or just poke around, 
        I’m glad you dropped by.

        I can do, what I’ve built, and how we can work together.
